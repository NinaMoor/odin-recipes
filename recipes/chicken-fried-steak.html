    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
      <p>Chicken Fried Steak is made with cuts of cube steak that have been battered and fried - 
        similar to the way chicken is fried, hence its name.  People love this dish because it really
        sticks to the ribs and can be made a million different ways according to your preference.
      </p>
      <p>Personally, I make my Chicken Fried Steak without the gravy because the dish is already thick 
        enough!  But there are plenty of gravy recipes and options out there if you prefer yours with some
        extra sauce.
