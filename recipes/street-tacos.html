    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
      <p>If you hate the Americanized version of tacos as much as I do, then these tacos are for you. They feed a lot
        of people quickly, won't keep you in the kitchen or over the grill for an extended period of time. If you're
        not a fan of steak meat, feel free to replace the carne asada with carnitas or chicken.
      </p>
      <p>My version of this dish is the simpliest version, but you can add salsa, queso or any other sauce to your liking.
